# Exercise 5.7

Develop `startElement` and `endElement` into a general HTML pretty-printer. Print comment nodes, text nodes, and the
attributes of each element(`<a href='...'>`). Use short forms like `<img/>` instead of `<img></img>` when an element
has no children. Write a test to ensure that the output can be parsed successfully. (See Chapter 11.)
