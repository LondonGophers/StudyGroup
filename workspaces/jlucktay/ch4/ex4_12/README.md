# Exercise 4.12

The popular web comic _xkcd_ has a JSON interface. For example, a request to `https://xkcd.com/571/info.0.json`
produces a detailed description of comic 571, one of many favorites. Download each URL (once!) and build an offline
index. Write a tool `xkcd` that, using this index, prints the URL and transcript of each comic that matches a search
term provided on the command line.
